                    to 2002 and again from 2014 onwards, have alternated with mostly unsuccessful qualification rounds.

                <h1>The England national football team</h1>
                <p> has represented England in international football since the first international match in 1872. It is
                    controlled by The Football Association (FA), the governing body for football in England, which is
                    affiliated with UEFA and comes under the global jurisdiction of world football's governing body
                    FIFA.[3][4] England competes in the three major international tournament contested by European
                    nations: the FIFA World Cup, the UEFA European Championship, and the UEFA Nations League.

                <p>England is the joint oldest national team in football having played in the world's first
                    international football match in 1872, against Scotland. England's home ground is Wembley Stadium,
                    London, and its training headquarters is at St George's Park, Burton upon Trent. Gareth Southgate is
                    the current manager of the team.</p>

                <p>England won the 1966 World Cup final on home soil, making it one of eight nations to have won the
                    World
                    Cup. They have qualified for the World Cup 16 times, with their best other performances being fourth
                    place in both 1990 and 2018. England has never won the European Championship, with their best
                    performance to date being runners-up in 2020. As a constituent country of the United Kingdom,
                    England is
                    not a member of the International Olympic Committee and so does not compete at the Olympic Games.
                    England is currently the only team to have won the World Cup at senior level, but not their major
                    continental title, and the only non-sovereign entity to have won the World Cup.</p>
